            "title": "1) s1: Simple test-time scaling  Researchers from Stanford, UW, and others introduce s1, a method to boost LLM performance by using extra compute at inference (\u201ctest-time scaling\u201d). Key ideas include: <br> \u25cf Small yet powerful dataset \u2013 They curated s1K, only 1,000  challenging questions with detailed reasoning traces, to fine-tune a  32B model. Despite the tiny data, this provides strong reasoning  exemplars.   <br> \u25cf \u201cBudget forcing\u201d for reasoning \u2013 A new decoding trick appends the  token \u201cWait\u201d when the model tries to stop, forcing it to think longer.  This leads the model to double-check and fix its reasoning step. By  also cutting off overly long reasoning, they control inference time.   <br> \u25cf Big gains over OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u2013 The resulting model (s1-32B) (a  fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) outperforms OpenAI\u2019s  o1-preview model by up to +27% on   competition-level math questions (MATH & AIME24). Notably, with  test-time scaling, it boosts accuracy on AIME24 from 50% to 57%,  surpassing its own normal limit.",

            "title": "2) OmniHuman-1: Scaling One-Stage Human Animation  A team at ByteDance AI Lab unveiled OmniHuman-1, a diffusion-transformer model that can generate highly realistic human videos from just a single image plus motion input (audio or video). Highlights:   <br> \u25cf End-to-end human video generation \u2013 OmniHuman takes one image (any  aspect ratio, from face only to full-body) and an audio clip or video  motion and produces a lifelike video of that person speaking, singing,  or performing actions. The outputs are remarkably realistic in motion,  lighting, and texture detail.   <br> \u25cf Mixed modality training \u2013 A key innovation is Omni-Conditions  Training: mixing various motion modalities during training  (audio-driven, video-driven, pose, etc.). This greatly expands the  training data and overcomes the usual scarcity of high-quality  talking-head video data. The model learns to handle diverse inputs  (speech, song, instruments) and challenging poses.   <br> \u25cf Outperforms prior methods \u2013 Compared to earlier one-stage models  (e.g. audio-driven talking heads), OmniHuman generates more realistic  videos and is more flexible in input types. It can even handle  cartoons or animal figures as input, transferring motion naturally to  each style.   <br> \u25cf Broader support \u2013 The approach supports any portrait content (face  close-up, half-body,   full-body) and multiple driving signals simultaneously. This  generality is a first for end-to-end human animation models.",

            "title": "3) LIMO: Less Is More for Reasoning  Can a handful of examples teach complex math reasoning to LLMs? This new LIMO paper challenges the notion that we need huge fine-tuning datasets for tough reasoning tasks. Key findings:   <br> \u25cf Surprisingly few examples \u2013 With only 817 carefully curated training  samples, the LIMO model achieves 57.1% accuracy on the AIME math  competition and 94.8% on MATH. This is a giant leap from prior  SFT-based models (which scored 6.5% and 59.2% respectively \u2013 using  just 1% of the data those earlier approaches needed.   <br> \u25cf Generalization with less data? \u2013 LIMO shows impressive OOD  generalization: a +40.5% absolute improvement on average across 10  diverse benchmarks, even outperforming models trained on 100\u00d7 more  data. This challenges the assumption that more data is always required  for complex skills and that fine-tuning only leads to memorization.   <br> \u25cf \u201cLess-Is-More\u201d Hypothesis \u2013 The authors propose that if an LLM\u2019s  pre-training has already endowed it with rich knowledge, then only a  minimal set of carefully designed examples (which they call \u201ccognitive  templates\u201d) is needed to unlock advanced reasoning. Essentially, the  model just needs to see how to use its knowledge, not thousands of  repetitive problems.   <br> \u25cf Open-source suite \u2013 The complete LIMO training suite is released for  the community, supporting further research on data-efficient  reasoning. This work hints that small, high-quality datasets might  yield state-of-the-art reasoning, lowering the barrier to fine-tuning  powerful LLMs.",

The model excels in STEM-related tasks, particularly in science, math, and coding, while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of its predecessor o1-mini. It introduces key developer features like function calling, Structured Outputs, and developer messages, making it  production-ready from launch.  o3-mini includes different reasoning effort levels (low, medium, and high) and improves performance across a wide range of tasks. It delivered responses 24% faster than o1-mini and achieved notable results in competition math, PhD-level science questions, and software engineering tasks.",

The models are built on a progressive training approach, starting with 4K tokens and gradually increasing to 256K tokens, then using length extrapolation techniques to reach 1M tokens. They've also released an inference framework based on vLLM that processes long inputs 3-7x faster through sparse attention methods.  The models show strong performance on both long-context and short-text tasks. The 14B model outperforms GPT-4o-mini across multiple long-context datasets while maintaining similar performance on shorter tasks.",

The model incorporates three key improvements: optimized training strategies with longer initial training and focused fine-tuning, expanded training data including 90 million new samples for understanding and 72 million synthetic aesthetic samples for generation, and scaling to larger model sizes up to 7B parameters.  Janus-Pro achieves significant improvements in both multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation capabilities. The model outperforms existing solutions on various benchmarks, scoring 79.2 on MMBench for understanding tasks and achieving 80% accuracy on GenEval for text-to-image generation. The improvements also enhance image generation stability and quality, particularly for short prompts and fine details, though the current 384x384 resolution remains a limitation for certain tasks.",
