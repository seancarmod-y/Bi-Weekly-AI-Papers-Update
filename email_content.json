This paper compares the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generators (RAG) and long-context Language Models (LLMs), finding that while LLMs outperform RAG on average, RAG is significantly more cost-effective, and proposes a method to leverage self-reflection to optimize performance and reduce computational cost.",
