            "title": "3) **A Statistical Approach to LLM Evaluation** - proposes five key statistical recommendations for a more rigorous evaluation of LLM performance differences. The recommendations include: 1) using the Central Limit Theorem to measure theoretical averages across all possible questions rather than just observed averages; 2) clustering standard errors when questions are related rather than independent; 3) reducing variance within questions through resampling or using next-token probabilities; 4) analyzing paired differences between models since questions are shared across evaluations, and 5) using power analysis to determine appropriate sample sizes for detecting meaningful differences between models; the authors argue that these statistical approaches will help researchers better determine whether performance differences between models represent genuine capability gaps or are simply due to chance, leading to more precise and reliable model evaluations.",

            "title": "2) **Scaling Laws for Precision** - introduces \"precision-aware\" scaling laws that predict how model performance is affected by both training and inference precision in LLMs; key findings include: 1) post-training quantization becomes more harmful as models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining actively detrimental, 2) training in lower precision requires increasing model size to maintain performance, and 3) when jointly optimizing model size, data, and precision, the compute-optimal training precision is around 7-8 bits and independent of compute; also reports that when the model size is fixed, compute-optimal precision increases approximately logarithmically with data; the authors validate their predictions on models up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens, showing that both very high (16-bit) and very low (sub 4-bit) training precisions may be suboptimal.",
